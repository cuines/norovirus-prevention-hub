# Norovirus Disinfection Fact Sheet

## Why Disinfection is Crucial

Norovirus is highly contagious and can survive on surfaces for days to weeks. Proper disinfection is essential to break the chain of transmission, especially in settings such as food service, healthcare, childcare, and cruise ships.

## Cleaning vs. Disinfecting

- **Cleaning** removes dirt, debris, and some germs from surfaces using soap or detergent and water. It does not kill viruses.
- **Disinfecting** uses an EPA‑registered disinfectant (or a bleach solution) to kill germs **after** cleaning. For norovirus, you must use a disinfectant that is effective against non‑enveloped viruses.

> Always clean surfaces first to remove organic matter, then disinfect.

## How to Prepare a Bleach Solution

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a chlorine bleach solution for disinfecting surfaces that may be contaminated with norovirus.

### Recommended Concentration

| Bleach Concentration (sodium hypochlorite) | Amount per 1 Gallon of Water |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Household bleach (5.25%–8.25%)             | 5–25 tablespoons              |

**Instructions:**
1. Use unscented household bleach.
2. Mix the bleach with cool or room‑temperature water (hot water degrades the active ingredient).
3. Prepare the solution in a well‑ventilated area.
4. Label the container clearly and keep it out of reach of children and pets.

### Application
- Apply the bleach solution to pre‑cleaned surfaces with a cloth or spray bottle.
- Let the solution remain on the surface for **at least 5 minutes**.
- Rinse food‑contact surfaces with clean water after disinfection.
- Discard unused bleach solution after 24 hours; it loses effectiveness over time.

## Safety First

- **Wear gloves** and eye protection when handling bleach.
- **Never mix bleach** with ammonia, acids, or other cleaning products—this can release toxic gases.
- Work in a **well‑ventilated area** to avoid inhaling fumes.
- Store bleach in its original container, away from heat and sunlight.
- If bleach contacts skin or eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water.
